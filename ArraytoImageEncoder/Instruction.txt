1 - Convert image to array
this can be done at https://notisrac.github.io/FileToCArray/
Shoutout to Notisrac
Make sure that
a) Code format is set to "Hex 0x00"
b) Pallete is set to "24bit RGB"
c) Seperate bytes for pixels is ON

2 Copy the generated array to the "Image" array in the script

3 set "WIDTH" and "HEIGHT" to thier respective values

4 Run the code

5 The converter file will be created in the same folder as the script under the name "imagefile.Image"
It can now be written into the screen using BoW's image driver

WARNING
If working with bigger files (only noticable if working on image sizes close to the entire screen)
the code doesnt generate a file, for whatever reason

To bypass this split the image by its middle horizontal axis, set the "HEIGHT" to half its real value,
delete the first two lines of the bottom part of the image, paste the bottom image data onto the end of
the top half of the image data and manually change the second line of the image data variable to desired
height


If done correctly the image should be displayed properly
